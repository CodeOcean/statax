 the package  {browse "https://github.com/haghish/Statax":manual on GitHub} 
 

{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
Statax package includes 2 engines for highlighting Stata code in HTML and LaTeX 
documents. The package hosts the JavaScript engine named {bf:Statax.js} and its 
required other JavaScript programs as well as the LaTeX engine named 
{bf:Statax.tex}. In addition, the package includes three additional syntax 
highlighter themes which are {bf:wrandler}, {bf:daring}, and {bf:sunset}. For the 
JavaScript engine, these themes have {bf:.css} file sufix and for LaTeX they 
have {bf:.tex} suffix. 

{p 4 4 2}
After installing the package, the engines and the optional themes are installed 
in the {help sysdir:PLUS directory} and thus you can use Stata to obtain the 
path to each file. For example, to find the path to LaTeX engine and the optional 
theme {bf:daring.tex} type:

    . findfile statax.tex, path(PLUS)
    . findfile daring.tex, path(PLUS)

{p 4 4 2}
The syntax highlighter engine is quite simple to include in LaTeX documents, 
beamer slides, HTML documents, blogs, and websites. The package also includes 
a quick installation that works by adding a single command in the HTML or LaTeX 
document. For tutorials and examples, visit
