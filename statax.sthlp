{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:Statax} is a JavaScript engine for hilighting Stata syntax in web-based 
documents. It can be used in online forum or any website or blog for highlighting
Stata syntax. The program acurately highlights Stata commands, {help functions}, string, 
local and global {help macros}, digits, comments, and braces. The engine can also 
highlight the operator signs, but since Stata does not highlight operators, the 
default CSS shows them in black color. 

{pstd}
Based on {browse "http://shjs.sourceforge.net/doc/gplv3.html":{bf:SHJS}} engine, 
a new JavaScript was written to highlight Stata syntax. In addition, a new JQuery 
program was written to highlight {help global} {help macro} syntax. The JavaScript 
file developed SHJS is called {it:sh_main.js} and the file developed by the 
author for Stata is named {it:stata.js}. The author also developed a CSS style 
sheet to create a syntax highlighter identical to Stata do-file editor, which is 
included in {it:Stata.css} file. 

{pstd}
Stata codes should be written in a {bf:<pre class="sh_stata">} tag, which is closed with {bf:</pre>}. For example:

{phang2}{cmd:<pre class="sh_stata"> }{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. sysuse auto, replace}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. regress price mpg}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:</pre>}{p_end}
