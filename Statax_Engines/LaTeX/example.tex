\section{Bugs}
If you'd like to help improving the package, here are 2 bugs. The first is Global Macros which can only be defined as keyword and thus, will be appearing in dark blue color. Can you help fixing that?The second bug is that I haven't found a way to highlight a line beginning with asteriks as a comment without effecting the multiplication sign.
